Even though ADDOP and MULTOP are placed accordingly to their precedence in the grammar,
when it comes to placing the right most factors at the bottom of the tree the
evaluator does not fully follow PEMDAS completely in a specific case.
In incorrectEval.txt, when the parser processes the line

thirdvar = 10 * 2 /5;

the evaluator evaluates 2/5 first and then proceeds to * 10 and we get 0.
The evaluator goes down the tree and sees that the * node has a right most child.
Then when the evaluator encounters the / node, the evaluator solves this expression first
and then moves up the tree where it encounters * 10 again.

This is in contrast from evaluating the line from left to right which would correctly follow
PEMDAS and we would get the correct answer which is 4.
